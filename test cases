#test cases for adding and updating and removing patient details

#we start by creting a class named 'HospitalTest'
class HospitalTest:
    def __init__(self):
#then we create an instance of the class hospital
        self.hospital = Hospital()  

#we define a test case to add patient 
    def test_add_patient(self): #this would test the adding of a patient to the hospitals patient list
        print("Testing adding a patient...")
        self.hospital.add_patient("Sara Khalid", 29, "None", "Fever") #we create a new patient to add with its unique details
        assert "Sara Khalid" in [patient.name for patient in self.hospital.patient_list] #we check if this patient was added 
        print("Test passed.") #this message would print to show that this test case was sucessful 


#we define a test case to update patient





#we define a test case to remove patient
