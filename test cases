#test cases for adding and updating and removing patient details

#we start by creting a class named 'HospitalTest'
class HospitalTest:
    def __init__(self):
#then we create an instance of the class hospital
        self.hospital = Hospital()  

#we define a test case to add patient 
    def test_add_patient(self): #this would test the adding of a patient to the hospitals patient list
        print("Testing adding a patient...")
        self.hospital.add_patient("Sara Khalid", 29, "None", "Fever") #we create a new patient to add with its unique details
        assert "Sara Khalid" in [patient.name for patient in self.hospital.patient_list] #we check if this patient was added 
        print("Test passed.") #this message would print to show that this test case was sucessful 


#we define a test case to update patient
    def test_update_patient(self): #to test the update of the patients information
        print("Testing updating a patient...") #this message would print to show the start of the tets
        self.hospital.add_patient("Sara Mohamed", 25, "None", "Headache") #we add a patient named Sara Mohamed with the inital information
        self.hospital.update_patient("Sara Mohamed", 26, "None", "Fever") #then we update the details of this patient
        updated_patient = next((patient for patient in self.hospital.patient_list if patient.name == "Sara Mohamed"), None) #we find the newly updated patient within patient list of the hospital
        if updated_patient: #this if statemnt checks if updated patient is found 
#we assert the age and current location of the patient being updated 
            assert updated_patient.age == 26
            assert updated_patient.current_condition == "Fever"
            print("Test passed.") #this print message shows we passed the test
        else:
            print("Patient not found.") #this print message shows that the patient wasnt found




#we define a test case to remove patient
